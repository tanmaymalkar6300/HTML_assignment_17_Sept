Q.What are HTML entities?
Ans. HTML entities are special codes that represent reserved characters, symbols, or characters with specific
meanings in HTML. They are used to display characters that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML code or
cause rendering issues in web browsers. HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a
specific code or name, and ending with a semicolon (;).

The 5 commonly used entities are :-
1. `&lt;` - Represents the less-than sign `<`.
2. `&gt;` - Represents the greater-than sign `>`.
3. `&amp;` - Represents the ampersand `&`.
4. `&quot;` - Represents the double quotation mark `"`.
5. `&nbsp;` - Represents a non-breaking space, which prevents the browser from collapsing consecutive spaces into a single space.

These entities are frequently used in HTML to represent special characters and symbols in a way that won't be misinterpreted as HTML markup.
